= Long Abstract: Oxygen Isotope variability in Southern Thailand

== Introduction
When studying oxygen isotopes locked away in speleothem carbonate one of the foundational problems is determining the physical processes driving the variability in isotope ratios. In the Asian context the primary driver has been hypothesized to be the annual monsoon system. Past observations have shown this system's isotopic signal, or fingerprint, to be highly irregular. The intrinsic noise of the climate system creates a limit to our ability to introspect past climate variability. The annual amount-weighted average of ^18^O in precipitation does not provide a useful proxy for annual monsoon intensity. However when noisy annual data is integrated on the decadal scale then these isotopic fingerprints become apparent. On the centennial and millenial scale we expect to be able to extract climate trends. Layered on top of this are additional sources of noise and distortion such as the non-linear integrating effects of the karst aquifer above the speleothem. When working in the field we also need to be cognizant of both noise added by our equipment as well as effective noise induced by our selection of measurement location. Once we have a good characterization of all sourced of noise can we make an assessment of what is measurable both through field measurements of water ^18^O as well as through ^18^O measurements of speleothem carbonate.

== The carbonate ^18^O record

One of the more complete records of carbonate ~18~O is the composite record from the Xian laboratory of HiaCheng

The record spans from the present back to 640kyr - which is near the limit of what is available to us through Uranium Thorium dating

The record shows a mostly bistable system where the 18O ratio changes regimes synchronous with changes in insolation. The most popular hypothesis is that this is due to a change in intensity of the summer monsoon system. As the record gets closer in time to the present and the time resolution increases, we start to see a lot of variability in the signal. However it is not immediately clear if this variability is due to rapid changes in the intensity of the monsoon (ie. signal) or if this due to some source of noise

== The Asian Monsoon system

The Asian monsoon system brings massive amounts of moisture from the Indian ocean and other equatorial regions to the Asian continent. Because of favorable winds and the large quantities of moisture transported over open ocean, even with frequent rain-out moisture can be transported over unusually large distances. The Asian monsoon is hypothesised to have a distinct isotopic signature due to frequent rain-outs that cause fractionation of the moisture being transported. Heavier water molecules that incorporate ^18^O (and deuterium) will preferentially rain out over the ocean, and as a result the moisture that manages to reach the continent during the monsoon season is isotopically lighter (relative to either a "background" of local tropical reprecipitation/convection or the shorter-lived winter monsoon system). Tieing measured isotope ratios to climate systems is still an outstanding problem. Hence quantifying both background precipitation as well as the summer monsoon as a sum of signal and noise (ie. X +/-Y d18O) is not yet possible. This is part of an ongoing project of mine and will be addressed separately.

== Daily Variation in Precipitation

Examining daily d^18^O values over the course of a year provides me with an initial window into the ^18^O variability

The data does show a clear seasonal variation in the amount of precipitation with a dry season at the start of the year during non-"La Nina" years. However no clear trend can be observed in the d^18^O data. Monthly averages over the course of ten years however suggest a "summer pattern" with isotopically lighter rains. This is congruous with our hypothesis of monsoon fractionation.

== Karst variability
The karst system above the speleothems (ie. the rock ceiling of the study location) has an effect similar to averaging precipitation over a long period of time. The karst body accumulates, mixes and releases precipitation that has percolated down through the soil horizon above. At my study site in Southern Thailand this takes the shape of a karst tower.

The choice of a karst tower greatly simplifies the hydrogeological picture as it minimizes complications due to lateral flow from adjacent karst bodies.

Within the karst body itself we expect different fracture flow and connections to the aquifer and surface. Different chambers, speoleothems and fracture lines should exhibit different responses to precipitation. As an initial assessment we evaluate and compare several locations within the karst tower

I expect there to be additional nonlinear responses to precipitation as light rains may evaporate before penetrating the soil horizon, while torrential rains may saturate the soil and flow over the sides of the tower. These potential nonlinear responses will be part of my future work at the study site and will require longer time series.

== Equipment variability

For a characterization of the karst aquifer we need to monitor the ^18^O of both the drip water in the cave as well as that of the precipitation above. However measuring precipitation above the tower presents several challenges.
- The top of the tower is not readily accessibly
- The dense jungle makes collection of primary precipitation challenging
- Leaf-drip water is location sensitive and introduces confounding factors such as wind direction and vegetation density
- Regular water sample collection atop the tower is logistically difficult

To approximate the karst-top, precipitation is collected at a nearby location situated about 200m away from tower wall. Rain showers in the area are often short and localized. To assess how sensitive sampling is to location, we collect concurrent samples at two locations situated ~500 meters apart

Both sites show remarkably similar large swings in d^18^O, which suggests that sampling relatively near the tower should only induce a very small error in the final assessment.

An additional potential area of bias is evaporation in the rain collection equipment prior to collection. All water samples, both inside and outside the karst tower, first go through a rain gauge to allow me to monitor the quantities and times water is collected. The rain gauges operate using a tipping spoon mechanism. Water can sit in the gauge housing from extended amounts of time  before flowing down to the collection vessel. While in the karst tower humidity is near 100% the same is not true for conditions outside. To assess is the gauge housing induces a evaporative bias we compare two different collection methods. One using the standard Davis rain gauge where the runoff sits in the internal housing before being collected down a hose to a sealed container. The reference design is a glass funnel which directly collects rain water into a closed pitcher.

Both results show similar ^18^O values which suggests that no evaporative fractionation is occuring prior to sample collection. An additional worry is that both collectors could exhibit fractionation from water droplets that lie on the funnel surface. However since each sampler's funnel was of a different diameter and made of different materials - and yet the final d^18^O values coincide. So I think it is safe to assume that no substantial fractionation is occuring on the funnel surface prior to the water being captured.


== Conclusion

For the time being a full assessment of isotope variability in Southern Thailand is not possible and more research on this topic needs to be conducted. However preliminary results show encouraging results that demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring both above ground precipitation and karst cave drip water. Noise introduced by both equipment and choice of location seem to be negligable. Once other sources of variability have been assessed I may extend these time series to quantify the induced error. However at the moment I feel other sources of noise will dominate
