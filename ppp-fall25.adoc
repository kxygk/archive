== A "complete" speleothem δ^18^O record

_The Asian monsoon over the past 640,000 years and ice age terminations_ *Hai Cheng et al.* Nature (2016)
image:plot/haicheng-all.svg[]

δ^18^O tracks changes in insolation

*Basic Questions:*

What climate process is driving changes in Oxygen isotope?

How does actual climate change with insolation?

=== !
image:plot/haicheng-zoom.svg[]


== A: Driver(s) of ^18^O (in China)

Monsoon rain has an isotopically light signature

image:diag/haicheng-2-state.svg[]

_Ideally we'd have a climate curve and not a δ^18^O curve_

*Unanswered Question:*

What is the other moisture source?

== A: Drivers of ^18^O (in Thailand)

image:maps/krabi/two-seas-monsoon.svg[]

== A: Theoretical Speleothem

Mixing water sources should be more obvious in Thailand.

image:diag/haicheng-2-monsoon.svg[]

*Question*

What summer/winter monsoon ratio does each point represent?

*Objective*

Measure rain water δ^18^O and find a summer/winter monsoon "fingerprint"

*Bonus Question*

Can we do better..? Can we track changes in each monsoon system?

_Maybe.._

== Precipitation
.Daily precipitation at the Krabi Airport (data subset)

Professor Lowemark has organized for daily water collection at the Krai Airport since 2011

== Monsoon index

.Rain compared to Monsoon Index

Monsoon Index generated by climate dipole bisection

== Monsoon classification

.Isotope measurements are classified as either generated by the summer or winter monsoon

Seasonal averages look insufficiant to explain monsoon variability

=== Monsoon Averages (Over 30mm of Rain)

Maybe only large rains penetrate the cave?

Large rains have a wider spread

|

- Topography creates a threshold system where only large winter monsoon fronts reach the western shore

- Mountains induce early precipitation of winter moisture

- Travel time over the continent gives more rain out time

- "Other" light rain near Krabi is due to local moisture from Phang Nga Bay

- Phang Nga Bay moisture is blown away during winter monsoons and doesn't mix with Winter monsoon derived rain
