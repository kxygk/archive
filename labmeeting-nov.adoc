== Abstract

Large scale climate processes,
in their interplay with topography,
leave distinct fingerprints on the spatial patterns of a region's weather.
If these patterns are isolated,
an observer of the weather is able to infer which climate system is active at any given time.
Building on the singular value decomposition (SVD),
we present a method for estimating climate-associated patterns.
Mirroring the method of empirical orthogonal functions (EOF),
the region agnostic method eschews tuning parameters and heuristics,
ensuring impartiality.
Key is recognizing that many climate phenomena form non-cooccurring dipoles.
Reduced to two dimensions by SVD,
weather records align around two dipole-associated linear combinations.
These combinations,
once isolated,
form the basis of regional two-state climate indices.
Unlike EOFs,
adjusted patterns can be compared across datasets and time periods.
We present an example using the IMERG precipitation dataset,
along with software for reproducing the results.
