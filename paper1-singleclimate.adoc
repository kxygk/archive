= SUPP: Single Climate Regions

== Background

Maybe the most climate region is one with a single monsoon-related rainy season.
At the seasonal scale,
these climate systems are may be more the norm than the exception.
In these degenerate cases SV1 will be giving you a good approximation of the climate related pattern.
No extra steps are needed.
Unfortunately,
at the moment there is no clear statistical method identifying which regions have climate dipoles.
An ad hoc method is looking at the singular values in a scree plot.
However,
in some situation two climate systems regions the magnitude of the second singular vector is very small.

For instance,
in China the winter monsoon system has fractionally small amounts of precipitation associated with it.
The rain barely registers and the screen plot looks like a single-system region.
However we can still extract a winter associate pattern:

=== Marrah Plateau
==== Region

As a case study we look at the Marrah mountains in southern Sudan. This massif lies at the edge of the Sahel and is subject to a single monsoon-driven rainy season. The massif's topography has some interplay with the monsoon related atmospheric configuration which drives the dominant precipitation pattern.

==== SVD Result

When we apply the SVD we actually get a very reasonable SV1 vector that captures the essential shape of rain around the mountain.
SV2 shows a strong North/South contrast.
This is a common SV2 pattern -
often seen when the selected region is too large.
This tries to capture the transition shapes as the climate system starts and stops.
Most frequently this is poleward.

==== Climate Bisection

When we do a climate bisection,
we first note the even spread of points in the SV1/2 subspace.
Measurements do not align along two vectors.
The single pattern is being torn apart in to two strange patterns.

There are potentially two issues at play:

- There is a North/South delay of climate onset.
- There is a non-linearity and breakdown is assumption *A3*

The former we've introduced.
The final index plot suggests to us that one pattern captures the onset/widthdrawl pattern,
while the other pattern is capturing the "center" of the climate season.
However,
a second look notes that the onset and withdrawl happen over many pentads.
This seems too long given the size of the region

As for the latter,
remember that one of the assumptions of the climate bisection was A3:
" The climate patterns in question scale in a near-linear fashion.
If it rains twice as much,
then it rains twice as much across the whole climate associated precipitation region"
This seems a more likely area of issues.
When there is just one climate shape then small intensity-related changes are captured in the 2D subspace.

Note that while these two shapes can be used as an approximation,
they do not have a solid physical interpretation.
They fundamentally are representing climate systems as mixing-signal systems,
which they are not.


==== Conclusion

It must be noted that globally,
most locations do not feature a bistable climate.
The most common scenario is a simple one-system precipitation climate
(at the seasonal scale).
In these locations no bisection tricks are necessary.
The first singular vector (or first EOF) extract sthe single pattern.

Ultimately there is no clear line between a two climate system and one where characteristic *A3* has broken down.
Non linearities in climate associated patterns may cause Onset/withdrawal periods to present patterns distinct from the main climate associated period.
Such situations need to be identified by the researcher on a case-by-case basis.

As was hopefully illustrated,
these scenarios are readily identified by inspecting the SVD and Climate Dipole Bisection result.
