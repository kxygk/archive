= SUPP: Non Cyclical climate systems

== Fig

=== African Great Rift Valley
==== Motivation

To illustrate the generality of our method,
we try it on an area which has irregular climate.
The Great Rift Valley has two dominant rainy season with extremely sparse precipitation.
In Ethiopia there are know as the Kermet and the Belg

==== Result

Both systems seem to be cleanly extracted.
They correspond to the two mountain ranges that form the rim of the Great Rift.
If we look at the raw data we see that indeed we never see rain on both mountain ranges simultaneously

While boreal summer Kiremt rains come at a consistent time every year, Belg "short" rains as a lot less consistent and associated . However the illutrated method has no issue extracting these patterns.
