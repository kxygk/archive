<p>The interplay between recurring atmospheric processes and local topography creates regular observable climatic phenomena. We present a novel method for analyzing the spatial distribution of atmospheric parameters at the mesoscale which will allows for the extraction of a pair of underlying climate-associated shapes. These shapes act as unique fingerprints that allow one to observe climate without having to characterize it, without needing to understand any of its dynamics, and without building any heuristics. Key to making this step is to make the observation that many climate phenomena come in non-coocurring pairs. For instance the Summer/Winter Monsoons, El Nino / La Nina and the positive and negative phases of many climate systems. The presence of one climate state precludes the occurance of the other. As a result of this bistability, when reducing the measured climate parameter to two dimensions (by singular value decompositon) we will observe clustering around two linear combinations of the basis vectors. These combinations can be found using a variance minimizing search, and in the absence of any tertiary climate phenomena, these combinations will correspond to best estimates of the underlying climate-induced patterns. These shapes form a new basis which corrects for the inherant deficiencies of the vectors derived in a typical EOF analysis. Once extracted, we can measure the presence of these shapes in the original data and build a two state climate index. Lastly, we demonstrate how to estimate the noise induces error at each index value and present several examples using the IMERG presciptiation dataset. An  accompanying program for reproducing the analysis is provided</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TODO:
- How similar are the two shapes?
- What is the "variance of the mean" of the calculated centroid?
- How sensitive are the shapes to uniform noise?
- Angular distribution plot
- Plots are normalized to the highest value in-image (but that&#8217;s not indicated anywhere)</p>

<h2 id="_introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Climate systems, such at the monsoons or El Nino/La Nina aquired their their names when people native to a region identified and labeled a recurring weather phenomena.
The modern scientist tries to be more specific and characterize the causes and signatures associated with a particular climate system.
However the original methodology, the pattern recognition that comes naturally to the untrained eye, still presents several distinct advantages.
Chief among them are it&#8217;s generallity and simplicity.
Pattern recognition has been applied in the numerical field, partcularly with the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD).
As applied in the atmospheric sciences this has been known as the EOF.
However results are often not meeting expectations.
Often the first EOF/singular-vector is used and subsequent ones are discarded.
Why are there issues?
And how to address them?</p>

<p>We then move on to using gridded precipitation data as provided by the IMERG Late dataset to help us demonstrate how our method yields a clear improvement in climate pattern extraction in real-world conditions. These are used at the monthly, daily and hourly levels.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The standard method for extracting signals from noise is based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). The method works in an interative fashion, calculating the induced matrix norm of the dataset, removing it from the data and then repeating the process. For a single signal system this produces the best approximation of the underlying signal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To observe the result we will work off of a known pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/pattern1.svg" alt="pattern1"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We then perturbe this pattern to generate a test dataset. These will represent an idealized climate induced precipitation pattern over a region. To make the example more concrete we imagine it as 12 monthly precipitation accumulations. Each row representing a year of rain</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Probably need cleaner plot axis</div>
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/synth1patt/all-cycle.svg" alt="all cycle"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SVD in effect performs a linear weighted sum of these input image such that we get a nice approximation of the underlying <code>t</code> shaped pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/synth1patt/sv-0.svg" alt="sv 0"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The algorithm selects weights such that they maximizes the energy of the sum (under the constraint that the vector of weights is of unit length). Such a sum effectively gives more weight to data that has a higher signal to noise ration and the result should be superior to a straight average of all the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the blue color indiciates negative values - a characterisitic of most SVD numberical routines is that the first singular vector will typically be negative. Inverting the sum&#8217;s values doesn&#8217;t alter the result, however for simplicity I will keep the output vectors unaltered</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We then expand the problem to a two pattern system. We have taken the last data set and substituted the last four months with a secondary pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/pattern2.svg" alt="pattern2"></span></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will act as a synthetic secondary winter climate pattern. We want to observe how a secondary signal affects our final analysis.</p>

<div class="title">Probably need cleaner plot axis</div>
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/synth2patt/all-cycle.svg" alt="all cycle"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now when we perform the SVD, EOF1 (or the first singular vector) looks problematic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/synth2patt/sv-0.svg" alt="sv 0"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dominant signal from before is the most prominent feature, but the secondary pattern is also visible - illustrating "Issue 3". This should disspell the myth that EOF1 is somehow a safe basis b/c it is no affected by the orthogonality constraint. EOF2 is even more difficult to visually interpret.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/synth2patt/sv-1.svg" alt="sv 1"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>EOF2 has to be orthogonal to EOF1. The iterative nature of the SVD algorithm had first removed EOF1 from the dataset before computing EOF2. Hence all the remaining data was orthogonal to EOF1 and their linear combination (EOF2) is also orthogonal. As a result EOF2 is even more strange and unrelated to the underlying signals. This is highlighting the reality of "Issue 2" - that all singular vectors are actually representing mixtures of all the signals and none can be directly interpreted as climate indicators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A detailed mathematical treatment of why all EOF vectors end up being mixtures is outside the scope of this paper. However in short, this is a byproduct of how the weights (the singular values) are assigned. At face value, adding in a secondary signal seems to run counter to the goal of maximizing the energy of the sum. However the maximization is done by maintaining the 2-norm of the weights at 1. This can restated as: the weights form a "unit vector" or the quadriture sum of the weights is equal to <code>1.0</code>. The quadriture sum means that counterintuitively, all else being equal, spreading weights out actually makes their direct sum a higher value. This can be illutrated by looking at the logical extremes. If all weight is assigned to one data point, then its weight will equal <code>1.0</code>. By contrast an even spread of weights across all data gives <code>N</code> weights of <code>1/sqrt(N)</code> and <code>N/sqrt(N) &gt; 1.0</code> for all values of <code>N</code>. The end result is that secondary signals get small weights assigned to them.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We work off of a real example so that the EOF problems can be visually confirmed. This will allow us to construct a simple correction that produces patterns with a much better fidelity to those we observe in the raw data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here we look at a Southern Thailand. The top of the Malay Pensinsula is climatologically challenging as it&#8217;s subject to two distinct monsoon systems. The summer monsoon brings moisture from the Indian Ocean and drives precipitation for most of the year, while the winter monsoon system brings moisture from the East - the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. There is also a short "dry season" at the beginning of the year that is modulated by the interannual ENSO system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Should be modified to the strip configuration??</div>
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/krabi/monthly/year-stack.svg" alt="year stack"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Visually the two systems produce rainfall in two distinct patterns. The summer months have rain on the west coast, predominantly in the northern most sections. The late fall and early winter months show rain the south eastern section. The rain patterns represent a complex interplay between the local topography and the synoptic scale atmospheric configuration for large fractions of the year. In this case the areas of most rainfall correspond to coastal high mountains upwind in their associated monsoonal systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the patterns are readily apparent in these monthly averages, we would like to extract the patterns in an objective manner (ie. without manual selection of "monsoon months" or any heuristics tuned to this climatological system). As a first attempt to observe the climate induces rain patterns, we perform a singular value decomposition on monthly rainfall. We choose a ten year period from 2011 to 2022 - for a total of 120 monthly snapshots.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/krabi/monthly/sv-0.svg" alt="sv 0"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first singular vector gives us something that looks quite similar to the west coast precipitation associate with the summer monsoon. Signal mixing is not as apparent as in the synthetic example b/c the summer monsoon dominates annual rainfall. Furthermore, unlike in the synthetic example patterns in nature tend to be smoother - thereby masking the underlying mixing. However a careful eye will note that there is an intensification of precipitation on the East coast which does not occur in reality</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/krabi/monthly/sv-0.svg" alt="sv 0"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second signular vector, orthogonal to the first, look even harder to interpret but seems to correspond to a very strong east west contrast.</p>

<h2 id="_isolating_correct_patterns_in_the_sv_subspace">Isolating correct patterns in the SV subspace</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The root cause of the observed problems with the singular vectors (ie. EOFs) is that both vectors represent a mixture of both climate signals. First we observe that at a high level the local climate system can be approximation as a noise dominated system of two signals. Both singular vectors provide two different mixtures of these two signals. So by virtue of there being just two degrees of freedom, a certain mixture of the two singular vectors should represent a summer pattern - meanwhile a different mixture should correspond to a winter mixture</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result we can reduce our problem space to two dimensions</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/krabi/monthly/sv-projs-plain.svg" alt="sv projs plain"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words we can replot all 120 data points along two axes. The X axis show how closely a day corresponds to the first EOF, while the Y axis shows how closely the data point corresponds to the second EOF. These two projections correspond to the first two columns of the projection matrix in the SVD.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When observed in this subspace we make our second key observation: that the two climate systems are non-coocurring. Either atmospheric parameters are in some summer monsoon associated configuration or in a winter monsoon associated one. Since these processes happen at synoptic scales, much larger than the zone under observation, there is very little time spent "in-between". For instance the onset of the monsoon at the Southern end and Northern end of the selected region has been estimated to differ by approximately XXX days.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two-state nature of the climate system means that in the 2D plane months form two clumps. Each monthy at a first approximation either look like one of two ratios of EOF1 to EOF2. To estimate these two ratios we use a procedure akin to Otsu&#8217;s method in computer vision. We subdivide the 2D subspace along all possible diagonal dichotomies and find the dichotomy which minimizes the total variance. Such a dividing line in essence ensures both halves form a tight grouping around each half&#8217;s mean</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/krabi/monthly/sv-projs.svg" alt="sv projs"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the optimal divisor has been selected (red dashed line), we find the centroid of each half (black dotted line). This represents our estimate of each climate-associated ratio. The centroid is calculates as the average ratio of EOF1 to EOF2 across all points in each respective half (ie. an average of the angles of each point). Each point has an estimated two dimensional error and the resulting centroids have errors of their own (see: Supplimentary: Error Analysis). While many data points cluster near the origin, indicating a low climate signal, they do not corrupt the resulting estimates. The error estimates near the origin tend to result in large angular errors (ie. EOF1/EOF2 ratios) and thereby tend to contributing very little to the centroid/pattern estimates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/krabi/monthly/top-pattern.svg" alt="top pattern"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can then draw the ratio specified for each centroid. Here we first look at the top centroid. The monthy in the top half are blue/purple and correspond to the late-fall/winter months. The pattern represented by the ratio indeed corresponds to the pattern we observed in the raw data and matches our intuitive understanding of the climate configuration during the winter monsoon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../fig/imrg/krabi/monthly/bottom-pattern.svg" alt="bottom pattern"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly the bottom half consists of summer months, and the centroid-associated ratio produces a mixture of EOF1 and EOF2 such that the resulting pattern looks like the summer monsoons we observed in the original data. Note how the previous artifacts we saw in EOF1, with spurous rains on the East coast, have completely vanished</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_error_analysis">Error Analysis</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are generally two related sources of error in the previous method. One is the error in each points' projection on the 2D singular vector subspace. This is a two dimensional error of each point&#8217;s decomposition into EOF1 and EOF2 components. The other is the error in the final patterns, ie. the calculated centroid of each half.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we projected on to EOF1 and EOF2 we implicitely work under the simplifying assumption that there are only two climate systems. The remaining singular vectors (EOF3, EOF4 etc.) form what is effectively a background noise with an expected mean of zero. However a stochastic process with an expected mean of zero will have a non-zero measured mean at each data point. This is known as the variance of the mean, and it is equal to the variance divided by the number of points. The errors in the projections occur due to the noise in the EOF1 and EOF2 regions have such a nonzero mean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Further complicating things, the background noise level is non-constant. Fortunately if the input data is high dimensional (ex: IMERG data is typically on the order of thousands of pixels get data point) the noise level can be estimated at each time point. Since the mean is already known (it is zero) we simply estimate the variance by looking at the variance of the data with EOF1 and EOF2 removed. However scaling the variance to get a variance of the mean is more complicated.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_applications_climate_patterns">Applications: Climate Patterns</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The previous steps have given us clean non-orthogonal climate patterns. These can serve as a basis for further research. First, the spatial distribution of the pattern itself can serve as a source of truth. Second, once the pattern is isolated we can look for it in future (and past) data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pattern as a source of truth can be useful when for instance looking at changes in atmospheric paraters. However this needs to be evaluated on a case by case basis. A more direct approach would be for instance validating a climate model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we are to run the identical method on ERA5 monthly precipitation for the same period</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We get the following winter monsoon associated pattern</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the following summer monsoon associated pattern</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the original data is at a coarser resolutions, the two patterns seem to generally correspond in this region.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_applications_climate_indeces">Applications: Climate Indeces</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the pattern to look for the presence of climate at past and future times can form the bases of constructing climate indeces. Many climate indeces are built on the bases of using EOF analysis - particularly the first singular vector, EOF1. These methods typically give plausible results due to two common phenomena. First, as was noted before, most climate phenomena come in pairs. Second, often climate phenomena are close negatives of each other when viewed as anomalies from the mean. The rain patterns derived for the Thai peninsula, if normalized to be around zero, resemble negatives of each other. Similar near-negatives can be imagines for other climate phenomena, like the El Nino equatorial warm water tongue vs the La Nina subtropical heating, or the positive and negative phases of the southern annular mode, or the north atlantic dipole. This means that EOF1 (which is done on an anomaly and not raw data) for many regions may produce a pattern which gives a one dimension estimate of both climate phenomena. This however is not a property that is universaly true - and doesn&#8217;t have a clear universal scientific rational</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using climate patterns provide by subspace bisection allows us to entirely avoid the serendipity of this second requirement. We treat each climate pattern separately and we will generate two independent indeces with non-comparable scalings. To build an index based on our climate data we simply need to project data on to our patterns. We use the bisecting line (red line Fig XX) to determine which pattern each data point should be projected on. The projection can either be done directly (ie. an innner product of the pattern and data) or can be done with a non orthogonal projection in the 2D singular vector subspace. We reject the nonorthogonal method because data points are conceptually attributed to one climate system or the other and don&#8217;t represent a mixture.</p>

The first error is at the pixel level, while the second error is in the final calculated weight</p>
