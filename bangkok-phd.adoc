== The complete speleothem ^18^O record


_The Asian monsoon over the past 640,000 years and ice age terminations_ *Hai Cheng et al.* Nature (2016)
image:plot/haicheng-all.svg[]

.*Hypothesis*: In South East China variations in ^18^O are driven by changed in the intensity of the summer monsoon system
* Synthetic record from multiple speleothems
* Very high temporal resolution - accurate in both time and amount (^18^O)
* Spans the full time span available with U-Th dating (~600kyr)
* ^18^O closely follows insolation (pick your latitude..)

.Outstanding questions..
0. Are you sure it's a monsoon signal..?
1. High frequency variations.. noise? signal? what's going on?
1. How does this look in different locations around Asia?
2. When speleothem *^18^O* changes, how exactly is the monsoon changing?

We get an added twist: A short (~2 month) Winter Monsoon system

== Two Monsoons on a local scale

We could also try to focus in on a very local region

PRO: Close proximity reduces the influence of secondary drivers of precipitation

CON: The &Delta;^18^O between closely spaced caves maybe be too small to detect

The karst system acts as a (low pass?) filter on the ^18^O signal we see in precipitation
