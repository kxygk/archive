= Looking for stalagmite ^18^O's connection to climate

by George Kontsevich (PhD Student)

_Qualification Exam_

image:phot/stalagmite-example.jpg[]

== A "complete" speleothem δ^18^O record

_The Asian monsoon over the past 640,000 years and ice age terminations_ *Hai Cheng et al.* Nature (2016)
image:plot/haicheng-all.svg[]

δ^18^O tracks changes in insolation

*Basic Questions:*

What climate process is driving changes in Oxygen isotope?

How does actual climate change with insolation?

=== !
image:plot/haicheng-zoom.svg[]

== The ^18^O source

image::diag/karst-3-proj.svg[]

== A: Driver(s) of ^18^O (in China)

Monsoon rain has an isotopically light signature

image:diag/haicheng-2-state.svg[]

_Ideally we'd have a climate curve and not a δ^18^O curve_

*Unanswered Question:*

What is the other moisture source?

== A: Drivers of ^18^O (in Thailand)

image:maps/krabi/two-seas-monsoon.svg[]

== A: Theoretical Speleothem

Endmembers should be more obvious in Thailand

image:diag/haicheng-2-monsoon.svg[]

*Question*

What summer/winter monsoon ratio does each point represent?

*Objective*

Measure rain water δ^18^O and find a summer/winter monsoon "fingerprint"

*Bonus Question*

Can we do better..? Can we track changes in each monsoon system?

_Maybe.._

== B: Conduit flow

image:diag/karst-conduit-composite.svg[]

We should expect non-linear responses to rain volume

== B: Inter-stalagmite variability

image:diag/karst-2-speleo.svg[]

Different stalagmites should have different responses to the rain

== C: The Speleothems

== C: Hendy Test

Progress: Performed Hendy tests

image:diag/hendy-example.png[]

_(Example Hendy Test)_

== B: Cave/Rain Monitoring

image:phot/collage.jpg[]


== B: Equipment isotopic distortion

image:diag/thammurd-equipment-onsite.svg[]

Comparing a simple glass funnel water collector with a Davis rain gauge

Both produce consistent results

== B: Temporal variability

image:diag/cave-d18O.svg[]

Monitoring multiple sites in the cave, we see that the δ^18^O of drip water generally varies as a slow place.

== B: Spatial consistency

image:diag/thammurd-500m-onsite.svg[]

Comparing the rain isotope values at two sides "D" and "X", separated by 500 meters in the vicinity of the karst tower

Both produce consistent results

== A: Longer rain isotope record - Krabi Airport

Rain monitoring near the cave is too short to for us to deduce climate related δ^18^O signatures

image:maps/krabi/two-seas-monsoon.svg[]

== A: Daily rainfall amounts and δ^18^O

image:plot/airport-isotopes-2011.svg[]

image:plot/airport-isotopes-legend.svg[]

== A: 14 Year record

image:plot/airport-isotopes.svg[]

(Showing first 7 Years of data)

== A: Attributing rain to climate systems

image:diag/haicheng-2-monsoon.svg[]

We need to average the monsoon days to calculate these endmembers

image:plot/airport-isotopes-2011.svg[]

*Missing Piece:*

What climate system is "active" during each sample day?

== A: Visual inspection of rain pattern

Looking at satellite precipitation maps we can "see" which climate regime is active during a particular month

image:imrg/krabi/monthly/year-stack.svg[]

- Satellite monthly cumulative rain maps (IMERG)
- 0.1 degree resolution

== A: 2 patterns in a singular value subspace

image:imrg/krabi/monthly/sv-projections-plain.svg[]

*Note*

Months cluster into two groups associated with the summer and winter monsoon seasons

== A: The two monsoon clusters are isolated by var minimization

image:imrg/krabi/monthly/sv-projections.svg[]

Minimizing the variance (ie. Otsu's method)

== A: SV mixture: Summer centroid

image:imrg/krabi/monthly/bottom-pattern.svg[]

== A: The two monsoon clusters are isolated by var minimization

image:imrg/krabi/monthly/sv-projections.svg[]

== A: SV mixtures: Winter centroid

image:imrg/krabi/monthly/top-pattern.svg[]

== A: Method replicates with daily precipitation data

image:imrg/krabi/monthly/sv-projections-monthly-daily.svg[]

Daily data gives near-identical patterns, but allows for a more fine-grained look at the changes in climate

== A: Index generation

image:imrg/krabi/monthly/indeces-monthly-daily.svg[]

Evaluating how far each month/day is along the median axis of each half allows us to quantify the strength of the monsoon pattern for each time-point



== A: Confidence in index

Rain patterns with the climate signal removed

image:imrg/krabi/monthly/designaled-long-linked.svg[]

The expected-value/mean of the noise is zero

However noise has induces a random shift in the measured climate signal

How can we estimate how large this shift was?

== A: Zero-mean noise's jitter

Generating normally distributed values around zero, they're mean is never exactly zero

image:diag/random-hist.svg[]

The variance of the mean is *_Var~mean~ = Var / √N_*

We know the number of pixels *_N_*

We can estimate the *_Var_* by looking our remaining noise

So we can quantify how much our signal may have been shifted *_Var~mean~_* before we removed it

== Can we blow up _N_?

image:diag/marrah-size.svg[]

Increasing the observational area increases *_N_* - But should that decreases the error in our climate estimate?

Feels like no.. Only jitter in climate pattern related areas should throw off the climate estimate

== A: Noise rebalanced

After having subtracted a scaled rain signal from original data we multiply it by the signal's norm to only consider relevant areas

image:imrg/krabi/monthly/designaled-weighted-long-linked.svg[]


The previous definition of variation-of-the-mean _Var/N_ now generalizes:

The original noise-pixel values are deviations from the mean (of *0*). The scaling factors depend on the climate patterns:

*Single Point Signal* => 1 _ie. no scaling_

*A Uniform Field* =>  1 / √N  _where N is the size of the climate rain "zone"_

If the field is uniform then after multiplication by the scaling factor if we just need to square the pixel values and sum them all up. This leaves gives us a sum of the squares of the deviation divided by the climate pattern size (in number of pixels)

The non-uniform case is similar, but with variable weights (the √N denominator varies)
