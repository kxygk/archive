= Fixing the Mesoscale EOF by Climate Dipole Bifurcation
George Kontsevich

== Abstract

Large scale climate processes,
in their interplay with topography,
leave distinct fingerprints on the spatial patterns of a region's weather.
If these patterns are isolated,
an observer of the weather is able to infer which climate system is active at any given time.
Building on the singular value decomposition (SVD),
we present a method for estimating climate-associated patterns.
Mirroring the method of empirical orthogonal functions (EOF),
the region agnostic method eshews tuning parameters and heuristics ensuring impartiality.
Key is recognizing that many climate phenomena form non-coocurring dipoles.
Reduced to two dimensions by SVD,
weather records align around two dipole associate linear combinations.
These combinations,
once isolated,
form the basis of regional two-state climate indices.
Unlike EOFs,
adjusted patterns can be compared across datasets and time periods.
We present an example using the IMERG precipitation dataset,
along with software for reproducing the results.

=== Introduction

Climate systems,
such at the monsoons or El Nino/La Nina,
acquired their names when people native to a region noted recurring weather patterns.
By contrast,
a typical modern approach for identifying climate system involves searching for and then characterizing repeated atmospheric configurations.
These can come in the form of heuristics based on historic data,
such as Wang and LinHo's (2002) monsoon onset and withdrawl thresholds system.
Another common approach is select a regions that is representative of a climate systems.
A good example is the monitoring of ENSO by sea surface temperature in the Nino 3.4 index,
as motivated by Trenberth (1997).
Nonetheless,
when climate systems are poorly understood or are still not well characterized,
the original methodology of pattern recognition comes naturally to the untrained eye.
While at times imperfect,
it presents a simple method that can be used regardless of location.
Pattern recognition,
as applied in the atmospheric sciences and oceanography,
has been typically done using empirical orthogonal function
(EOF)
analysis.
The resulting patterns,
(EOF1 EOF2 EOF3 etc.)
are meant to roughly represent the patterns that repeat in the weather observations.
The quality of these patterns is variable,
*and as a result they are often viewed with a degree of skepticism.*
Notwithstanding the issues,
they still find use as a starting point for further quantitative analysis.

As will be explored,
the fundamental issues affecting EOFs are:

O1:: EOF patterns are orthogonal,
climate-associated patterns are generally not.
O2:: All EOF patterns,
including EOF1,
represent mixtures of all the underlying signals.
O3:: EOF1 will often be heavily biased towards the dominant climate signal.
This makes the result often looks correct and masks the mixing.

A typical way to define the EOF vectors is as the "eigenvectors of the cross-covariance matrix between grid points" -
as seen in North et al.
(1982).

The crosscovariance matrix means the EOF is built around the anomaly from some mean.
While the anomaly is a seemingly sensible starting point,
it actually becomes a source of hard-to-resolve issues.
In the presence of multiple climate systems,
the mean will consist of a static mixture of all the observed patterns.
These contaminate all the anomalies.
For instance,
a region under the influence of summer and winter monsoon systems,
will typically exhibit some unique patterns associated with both system
(largely due to the region's terrain).
Observed over several seasons,
any mean would consist of a mixture of these patterns.
Consequently,
calculated anomalies
(the differences between this mean and each observation)
also end up having a mixture of every observed pattern.
For example,
anomalies in the summer months will not only have the anomaly of the varying summer monsoon,
but they will also have a bit of static winter monsoon signal present.
(and the inverse will occur for the winter anomalies).
Working off of anomalies forces us to look for ways to disentangle these mixed datapoints to deduce the original patterns.

To sidestep this issue we first use an alternate,
mathematically equivalent,
formulation of the EOF.
We treat the EOF vectors as the singular vectors of the singular value decomposition (SVD).
We can then drop the anomaly requirement and do a direct SVD of the normalized observations.
See **SUPP**
All the listed issues (O1..4) will hold just as well for the SVD as for the EOF.

Our first goal will be to demonstrate these issues using a synthetic example.
While the synthetic weather model will be extremely basic,
it will to allow us to know a-priori which climate patterns are present.
When we try to extract patterns,
using the SVD,
we can observe discrepancies with the originals we have in-hand and think about solutions.
We will then repeat the SVD/EOF on a real dataset -
the "IMERG Late" gridded precipitation dataset
(**SUPP** Notes on IMERG).
We will look at precipitation over Peninsular Southern Thailand,
which has both summer and winter monsoon rains.
The region was chosen because of ongoing paleoclimatological work in the area.
(Tan et al. 2019)
When observing the real climate associated patterns,
as well as their SVD,
we will find that they all share a few important properties.
These will allow us to simplify the mathematical problem significantly,
and to construct a solution.
After a brief diversion in to possible applications we will discuss the limitations of the method.
Our objectives are:
first,
to conclusively illustrate the problems with the EOF/SVDs;
second,
to presenting a simple method for resolving them.

=== Synthetic illustrations of the EOF/SVD problem

Using a synthetic dataset allows us to not only observe the aforementioned problems
(O1 O2 O3),
but it will also give us insight in to a possible solution.
We start by creating two arbitrary patterns,
representing the two states of our climate system.
Since the pattern were chosen at random they will not be orthogonal to each other
(anticipating issue *O1*).
When generating synthetic "observations" one or the other pattern is selected.
Then pixel values are drawn from the exponential distribution,
with the pattern providing the mean value.
For ease of interpretability,
the observations are arranged to mimic monthly precipitation accumulations of a monsoonal region.
First there are several summer-equivalent patterned observations.
This is followed by a shorter period of winter-equivalent patterned observations.

**SUPP** (With and image of the full data?)

When we look at the first two singular vectors (SV) generated by the SVD,
the first thing that stands out are the negative values in the first singular vector (SV1).
These values,
colored in blue,
are characteristic of most SVD numerical routines. **ADD REF**
Most such routines,
when run on purely positive observation such as rain,
will return negative values for the first singular vector.
In practical terms this does not turn out to be meaningful.
As a basis vector the sign could be safely inverted;
one would just need to invert all subsequent weight values.
Since it would be of no practical benefit,
we keep the singular vectors unaltered.

The next thing we notice are the mixed signals.
As we had stated in *O2*,
the SVD's singular vectors all end up looking like a mixtures of our original patterns.
For many climatologists it may come as a surprise that the first basis
(equivalent to EOF1)
has also been affected.
This mixing is a direct consequence of how the SVD is designed to extracts patterns.
He leave a detailed discussion of the causes of this mixing to **SUPP**
For the purposes of finding a resolution we just need to know:
mixing does occur,
the mixing happens at a ratio that we do not know a priori.
Perhaps not surprisingly,
by adjusting the occurrence of each pattern in the synthetic dataset the amount of mixing in SV1 can be varied.
As a result,
we must conclude that comparing SV1 or EOF1 patterns from different sources is inadvisable.
Any differences can be due to changes in either:
the underlying climate associate patterns,
or a change in climate system ratios.
The two are indistinguishable without more information.
Interannual systems are particularly prone to changes in mixing.
With certain decade often preferentially favoring one climate phase.

The next and perhaps even more glaring issue is the second Singular Vector (SV2).
The orthogonality condition of the singular vectors means SV2 is orthogonal to SV1.
What is interesting is that,
even under this constraint,
the SVD produces a different mixture of the two original patterns.
This time the pattern contains both negative and positive regions.

The remaining singular vectors contain virtually no sign of the patterns.
While we don't provide a rigorous proof,
the result comes naturally when viewing the degrees of freedom of the system.
The original two signals provided two degrees of freedom in our observations.
By removing the projections of two arbitrary signal-mixtures we must remove both signals from all the observations.

The first two SVs being different mixtures of the underlying signals,
ends up being the critical piece that will allow us to build a correction.

=== Case Study: South East Asian monsoon systems


****
For the sake of visual clarity,
we present daily accumulations binned to pentads
(with leap days removed).
However,
daily to monthly,
at all bin sizes results are nearly identical.


The final region size was not tuned and was selected for illustrative purposes.s
****


We now repeat the same analysis on a real-world example in southern Thailand.
Here we do not have a priori knowledge of the climate associate patterns.
However,
we have enough of a high-level understanding of the climate to confirm the SVD/EOF problem.
Once confirmed,
we can construct a easily interpretable correction.

A preliminary visual inspection of monthly precipitation shows us that there are two distinct patterns. *SUPP*
The summer months have rain on the west coast,
predominantly in the northern-most part of the region.
The late fall and early winter months show rain in the south-eastern section.
These two rain patterns correspond to summer and winter monsoon systems.
The areas with the highest rainfall correspond to coastal mountains downwind of their corresponding monsoonal systems.

As in the synthetic example,
we first try to extract the underlying patterns by SVD.
The first singular vector gives us a shape that looks encouraging.
At face value it seems similar to the summer monsoon associate precipitation.
While our synthetic example showed that mixing must be happening
(issue *O2*)
it is not immediately apparent in this image due to a couple of reasons:

- First,
unlike in the more balanced synthetic example,
here summer monsoon rains form a dominant fraction of the annual total.
Issue *O3* strongly preserves the pattern.
- Second,
unlike our synthetic patterns,
natural patterns are typically smooth and their mixtures look physically plausible.
Here only a careful eye will note the issue with the EOF1 pattern.
There is a small intensification of precipitation on the East coast -
it does not in actuality occur in the summer months.
This distortion is only easily identified when compared to the corrected patterns.

The second singular vector,
orthogonal to the first,
shows a strong east west contrast with both positive and negative values.
Not only does this not look like either climate system,
since we aren't working off an anomaly
(like in an EOF analysis),
to have physical meaning in isolation,
a climate-associated pattern of precipitation should be positive.
Inverting the vector's values doesn't solve the issue;
as it would just creates other negative zones.
Just by noting this,
we can already see that it must co-occur with a positive EOF
(such as EOF1)
to add up to something that is physically possible.

=== Isolating correct patterns by SV subspace bisection

We already know,
from our synthetic example,
that the root cause of the observed problems with the singular vectors stem from them representing mixtures of the underlying climate signals (*O2*).

Unless you are in a region with a single dominant climate system,
the singular vectors can not be safely used directly.
Unfortunately there is no simple way to differentiate single climate regions from multi-climate ones.
Such situations need to be identified by the researcher on a case-by-case basis.
For an indepth look at the common indicators of single system regions as well as associated challenges,
please see the Marrah Plateau example in **SUPP**

To isolate the climate systems we need to assume three simplifying characteristics:

A1:: the local climate system can be approximation as a noisy system of two signals.

A2:: these two climate systems by-in-large don't undergo any mixing.
In other words the two climates do not coocur.

A3:: The climate associated weather patterns scale in a near-linear fashion.
If it rains twice as much,
then it rains twice as much across the whole climate associated precipitation region.

These assumptions were in-fact implicit in the design of the synthetic example.

The critical reader will likely start to see situations where these simplifying characteristics do not hold.
Discussion of what happens when these assumptions break down is deferred till the end.
For the moment we will treat them as good approximations.

Characteristic *A2* will be at the root of fixing the SVD's climate signal mixing.
It is not noted often enough that many climate systems,
when observed at a particular location,
implicitly form dipoles.
This describes not only the winter and summer monsoons,
but also interannual systems such as El Nino/La Nina.
There are many more such systems,
such as the Indian Ocean Dipole,
the Madden Julian Oscillations,
the Southern Annular Mode,
the North Atlantic Oscillation as well as many others.
The key characteristics they all share is that at the regional scale these are in either in a positive, negative or transition state.
While some,
as will be discussed,
are described in terms of a sum of two stationary waves,
the cumulative process for a particular location still adheres to this general principle.

Assuming *A1* to be generally true,
and building on the intuition we developed in the synthetic case,
we can then interpret the first two singular vectors as each making an estimate of some unique mixtures of the two underlying signals.
By virtue of there being just two degrees of freedom,
certain combinations of the two SVs should give back each of the two underlying patterns
(in our case - the summer/winter monsoons)

==== Dimension reduction
To search for the correct SV combinations we first simplify the problem.
We reduce our problem space to two dimensions,
replotting all our observations on to the SV1/SV2 plane.
This can be done either by an inner product of every observation with SV1 and SV2,
or by extracting the first two columns of the SVD's left-singular-vector matrix.

The discarded SVs
(SV3 SV4 ..)
in aggregate form a noise-like factors.
They can be used to estimate an upper bound on the errors in the SV1/SV2 projections.
These error bounds can help refine our final pattern estimates.
However,
since it is tangential to the main thrust of the method we leave this to a supplementary section. **SUP**

Looking at our observations in this reduced 2D subspace,
we immediately see the effect of the second simplifying assumption *A2*.
The climate dipole causes most observations to form along two lines through the origin.
One grouping is dominated by summer (yellow) pentads while the other winter (blue/purple) pentads.
The two vectors,
along which the observations are aligning,
can also be interpreted as representing a ratio of SV1 and SV2.

In our synthetic example we saw the SVs came out as mixtures of the original climates patterns.
Now we are seeing the inverse process;
the ratios of SV1 and SV2 that represent each alignment vector will serve to "unmix" the singular vectors and recover the patterns.

==== Estimating SV mixtures
To find these climate associate vectors we use a procedure akin to Otsu's method -
from computer vision
(Otsu 1979).
We first subdivide the 2D subspace along all possible dichotomies.
We then find which bisecting line minimizes the total variance of the both halves;
ensuring that both halves form two tight groupings.
Since each observation corresponds to a mixture of SV1 and SV2,
the variance is in fact done in angular space.
The previously mentioned noise-like singular vectors
(SV3 SV4 ..)
can provide us with angular error;
allow one to apply an inverse-variance weighting
The error estimation and weighting is explained in greater detail in **SUPP**
Once the optimal bisector/dichotomy has been selected
(red dashed line),
the angular mean of each half gives us the SV1 SV2 mixture to reconstruct the climate-associated pattern.
(dashed line).

With reconstructed patterns in-hand,
we see if they correspond to what we visually observed in the original data.
Indeed,
top and bottom mixtures closely correspond what we see in the summer and winter months.
Note how the previous artifact we saw in SV1,
with spurious rains on the East coast,
has completely vanished.
Also notice how SV1's positive offset is gone.
We now get near-zero rain over downwind ocean sectors.
Most importantly, all patterns are positive.

=== Applications: Climate Patterns

The resulting patterns can serve as the basis for further research.
Unlike EOF1 patterns,
Climate bipole bisected patterns can be compared between datasets.

The pattern shape,
has been interpreted as a static.
However,
on longer term time scales one anticipates reconfigurations in the climate arrangement
(ex: wind direction)
It is now feasible to comparing subtle changes in climate patterns over different periods.
Climate patterns,
can further serve as sources of truth for validating climate models and reanalysis datasets.
Discrepancies,
if found,
could be a potential avenue for further investigation.

=== Applications: Climate Indices

Coming back to our original thesis.
Maybe more importantly,
these patterns allow us to objectively estimate the presence of climate in past and future observation.

When working within a properly tuned region,
one may find EOF1
(which is done on an anomaly and not raw data)
produces a pattern which gives a workable estimate of both climate phenomena.
It's not uncommon for the dipole to form a mirrored pair of anomalies.
In our case study region,
with some adjustments,
the anomaly could be made to go high/low in the northwest and low/high in the southeast.
Such an EOF1 would require validation by other heuristics,
because we can not count on this being true for an arbitrary region.

Our climate dipole bisection avoids the serendipity of these extra symmetry requirements.
We not only don't need to characterize the climate or construct heuristics,
but we can also look at the presence of climate dipoles in less convenient regions.
This opens the door to potentially observe climate through regional patches;
allowing one to construct a synoptic scale understanding of climate systems.

To build an actual index we simply need to project observations on to our patterns.
We use the bisecting line (red line Fig 2) to determine which climate system each observation belongs to.
The projection should be done directly -
ie. an inner product of the pattern and data

The resulting climate patterns do no form a true physical basis -
such as one produced in a Rotated EOF method.
This makes orthogonal projections inappropriate in this scenario.
A more in depth exploration is left to **SUPP**

The projections' error bounds can be estimated the previously mentioned projection errors.
See **SUPP**.

Once the index is constructed,
to have the index trend with precipitation volume,
index values can generated on de-normalized observations.
In rare cases with an extremely weak climate phases,
the denomalized observations can squash the weaker phase making the negative phase hard to observe.
**SUPP** *HAINAN*

It's important to note that,
denormalized or not,
the two resulting climate indices are not comparable.
Unlike a tuned EOF1 region which operates with one pattern,
here we have two separate patterns that are being projected on.
As a result,
one can not make statements such as
"This year's summer monsoon was 20% stronger than the winter monsoon".
EOF1 based climate indices implicitly make such comparisons possible,
but the conclusions are likely erroneous and highly dependent on the selected region.
With two separate patterns such comparisons become explicitly not possible.

To see a daily climate index,
see *SUPP*.

=== Conclusions and limitations

Using a synthetic example,
we started with a typical EOF-like analysis and observed the resulting issues.
We reformulate the EOF and skip the anomaly calculation,
leaving us with an SVD of unaltered observations.
On visual inspection,
we see that the singular vectors are preserving climate patterns in a mixed state.
Then,
through a set of simplifying assumptions,
we formulated a simple physically interpretable method for extracting the patterns back out.

The main points of failure worth discussion center mainly around breakdowns in our simplifying assumptions.
Some degree of breakdown in each assumption will always be present.

==== A breakdown in assumption *A1*
This is caused by two types of regional climate configuration:

As we mentioned at the start,
the most common climate configuration is the single climate pattern -
that is then forceably bisected.
An example of such a scenario is explored further in **SUPP**

The other scenario of concern is the presence of tertiary climate systems.
We have not yet been able to identify any non-cooccurring tertiary systems
(ie. a climate tripole).
We do however find climate systems that take effect in parallel to the main dipole.
However,
even after searching,
we have found it difficult to find regions where such tertiary systems are very clearly visible.
While we naturally encourage evaluating each region on a case by case basis,
such systems have a tendency to be significantly weaker than the dominant dipole.
For instance,
in southern Thailand,
there is both the short-period MJO system as well as the interannual ENSO.
Both are not easy to spot in the raw observation.
Nonetheless,
such tertiary systems are know to us a priori,
and we can be confident they will be skewing the climate patterns somehow.
Through a careful look at the daily precipitation climate index,
we do manage to detect the MJO as a intermittent index reversal.
See **SUPP**
The affected observations likely constitute a small minority of the data.
From the perspective of the climate bisection method,
skewed patterns map poorly to the SV1 SV2 subspace.
Using the extended error bounds these skewed observations show up as "high noise",
thereby having little weight in the final averaging.
While we do not present any concrete evidence,
we surmise it has a negligible impact on the resulting SVs and final patterns.

A holistic framework for accounting for tertiary signals will be an area of future work.

==== A breakdown in assumption *A3*

Imagining a scenario with a breakdown in *A3*,
we would expect different climate-associated patterns between strong and weak monsoon periods.
Climate systems are rarely truely linear,
and our analysis of single-climate regions suggests that this does occur to some extent.
See **SUPP**
However,
the fact that observations lie mostly along the ratio vectors strongly suggests that *A3* is a safe approximation.
Climate intensity derived skewing,
just like tertiary system derived skewing,
is effectively treated as noise during reduction to the 2D SV subspace.
Again,
error bound estimation can give highly skewed outliers lower weight -
improving results.
We can get a sense for the extent of intensity based skewing by denormalize observations before projecting on to SV1 and SV2. *MAYBE I SHOULD ALWAYS DENORMALIZE ONCE I'VE GOTTEN MY SV1/SV2?*
One would expect the climate grouping to drift off-axis based on the distance to the origin
(the distance to the origin being a metric of climate intensity).
Arguably in our case study the summer monsoon half does show a small off-axis trend.
**SUPP.. or just denormalize everywhere so I don't need to make a special figures**

==== A breakdown in assumption *A2*
When climate dipoles don't cleanly separate it is typically for the following three reasons:

.the observed parameter is slow to change.
For instance,
when looking at a monsoonal region,
one typically sees a period of wind reversal.
Here a pattern will be hard to define.
The observations made during switch-over can be of any shape,
and there is no mathematical constraint.
However,
working with real data we find that,
when projected on to the SV1 SV2 subspace,
these observation have always mapped to the region between the two climate pattern mixtures
(ie "in the wedge").
"Switch-over" observation are inevitable in any dataset,
however in the case of extremely slow parameters,
they can start to form a significant fraction of the observations.
This is a very typical for parameters such as sea surface temperature.

.the region under observation is too large.
For instance,
a region's southern section may be under a monsoonal regime,
while the northern section has not yet been affected.
For the Asian monsoon region,
delays in onset and withdrawal can be estimated using the maps made by Wang and LinHo (2002).
From these grids we can approximately estimate that the seasonal switch overs in southern Thailand will happen over ~1-4 pentads.
While we should always expect some switch-over observations -
in large regions we still start to generate a different class of singular vector.

The SVs are effectively describing observations as the sum of static patterns.
To describe dynamic systems,
such as a propagating wave,
the decomposition typically degenerates to sums of phase-offset stationary waves.
Such decompositions are useful.
They're often explicitly used to characterize wave-like climate systems -
such as the MJO. **Ask Prof Zeng for REF**
However,
such stationary waves are not patterns that are physically meaningful in isolation.
Fundamentally a wave pattern doesn't have a positive or negative end point.
Such patterns can typically be phase shifted while preserving their ability to describe the wave propagation.
Fortunately at a small enough scale
(fraction of the wavelength)
wave-like structures look once again like dipoles.
As the wave crest and trough goes through the region,
we once again have positive, negative and transition states.
This issue stresses the need for high density mesoscale data,
such as the IMERG dataset.
They allow us to select regions that are as small as practical.
A region's minimum size is dictated by two factors:
The regional topography's ability to drive distinct patterns in each phase of the dipole.
The lower value between "number of observation" and "number of points/pixels" dictates the total number of singular vectors.
This may affect the ability to segregate signal from noise. *A BIT UNCLEAR WHY.. TO THINK ABOUT MORE..OR REMOVE?*
Note that the case study was not tuned to a minimal region size -
as our objective was to illustrate climate pattern extraction.

.the temporal resolution is too coarse.
If we perform the dimension reduction on monthly precipitation averages we will often find months where both climate systems are active. *SUPP*

In the first two scenarios transition-associated patterns are of an unpredictable shape.
However,
in this third scenario,
as an artifact of integration time,
signals are being actually added together.
This is a bit unusual,
as we do not expect different climate dipoles phases to combine linearly.
The integration-time driven mixing is not indicative of any underlying physical process.
Nonetheless,
looking at the SV1/SV2 subspace,
affected observations will consistently lie between the two climate vectors.

For a simple case of a breakdown in *A2* we look at sea surface temperature in the South China Sea in **SUPP**.
In such cases,
a large enough breakdown ends up severely skewing the estimates of the ratio axis
(typically towards the mean of the two patterns)

[*Maybe remove this paragraph..? Or maybe it's important*]
We do not present any universal turn-key way to label transitional or mixed observations.
In many cases such observations constitute a small fraction of the total,
and therefore have a minimal impact on the final patterns.
Issues can be minimized with a good estimate of the error bounds.
Transition states map poorly to the SV1/SV2 vectors.
See: **SUPP**
On a case by case basis one may wish to build region specific heuristics.
If one has special insight in to climate transitions
(ex: there is some a priori knowledge that seasonal transitions happen twice a year)
then one may try to find criteria for removing problematic observations from the SVD.
We have not found such heuristics necessary,
and caution they may mask other issues.
(See the MJO signal in **SUPP**)
By looking at the SV1/SV2 plot,
it seems evident that even in the ideal case,
any adjustment of the mixing ratio would at best give an extremely modest improvement to the final patterns -
while introducing problematic tuning parameters.

All these issues notwithstanding,
even in the presence of severe skewing,
climate dipole bisection provides a clear improvement over raw EOF vectors.
The EOF basis is guaranteed to be an incorrect mixture,
and the second EOF's orthogonality constraint almost guarantees it will miss the mark.
Climate dipole bisection presents a clear,
physically motivated and mathematically simple correction.
There are many alternate methods for trying to correct the EOF.
These are broadly called "EOF rotations", **REF**
and typically try to use SVD rotation methods from applied mathematics on the EOF.
Not only do they persist in being built around the anomaly
(as opposed to raw observations),
but they end up apply methods that have a much more complicated problem in mind;
where signals from different sources are cooccurring in a background of noise.
In the broader signal processing realm,
methods such as the SVD can then be used for such things are denoising.
Special methods like Independent Component Analysis leverage statistical properties of the signals to estimate the original "unmixed" signals.
However,
climate associate patterns sit in a special simpler subset of pattern extraction problems.
As we've hopefully illustrated,
once we assume a very minimal set of properties,
the non-cooccurance of climate dipoles creates a special case where pattern extraction is greatly simplified.
When observing a large phenomena over a small region,
rotations of the EOFs to form a corrected/rotated basis is no longer physically motivated.
Since dipole phases can not undergo mixing there no underlying physical basis to estimate.
**SUPP** *Climate Dipole Bisection as a EOF Rotator*.
In situations where climate system do mix,
they do not mix in a linear/additive fashion like electrical signals.
Hence linear methods such as EOF/SVD should not be used in isolation.
Such cooccuring systems will be the scope of future work.

Because the method as presented has no tuning parameters or climate system specific considerations,
the resulting patterns have the impartiality and repeatability that allow it to become a consensus result that can form the start of further research.
