<h1>SUPP: Breadowns in CDB Assumptions</h1>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_intro">Intro</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main points of failure worth discussion center mainly around breakdowns in our simplifying assumptions.
Some degree of breakdown in each assumption will always be present.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_breakdown_in_assumption_a1">A breakdown in assumption <strong>A1</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is caused by two types of regional climate configuration:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we mentioned at the start,
the most common climate configuration is the single climate pattern -
that is then forceably bisected.
An example of such a scenario is explored further in</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="./paper1-singleclimate.html">SUPP Single Climate Region</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other scenario of concern is the presence of tertiary climate systems.
We have not yet been able to identify any non-cooccurring tertiary systems
(ie. a climate tripole).
We do however find climate systems that take effect in parallel to the main dipole.
However,
even after searching,
we have found it difficult to find regions where such tertiary systems are very clearly visible.
While we naturally encourage evaluating each region on a case by case basis,
such systems have a tendency to be significantly weaker than the dominant dipole.
For instance,
in southern Thailand,
there is both the short-period MJO system as well as the interannual ENSO.
Both are not easy to spot in the raw observation.
Nonetheless,
such tertiary systems are know to us a priori,
and we can be confident they will be skewing the climate patterns somehow.
Through a careful look at the daily precipitation climate index,
we do manage to detect the MJO as a intermittent index reversal.
See <strong>SUPP</strong>
The affected observations likely constitute a small minority of the data.
From the perspective of the climate bisection method,
skewed patterns map poorly to the SV1 SV2 subspace.
Using the extended error bounds these skewed observations show up as "high noise",
thereby having little weight in the final averaging.
While we do not present any concrete evidence,
we surmise it has a negligible impact on the resulting SVs and final patterns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A holistic framework for accounting for tertiary signals will be an area of future work.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_breakdown_in_assumption_a3">A breakdown in assumption <strong>A3</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagining a scenario with a breakdown in <strong>A3</strong>,
we would expect different climate-associated patterns between strong and weak monsoon periods.
Climate systems are rarely truely linear,
and our analysis of single-climate regions suggests that this does occur to some extent.
See <strong>SUPP</strong>
However,
the fact that observations lie mostly along the ratio vectors strongly suggests that <strong>A3</strong> is a safe approximation.
Climate intensity derived skewing,
just like tertiary system derived skewing,
is effectively treated as noise during reduction to the 2D SV subspace.
Again,
error bound estimation can give highly skewed outliers lower weight -
improving results.
We can get a sense for the extent of intensity based skewing by denormalize observations before projecting on to SV1 and SV2. <strong>MAYBE I SHOULD ALWAYS DENORMALIZE ONCE I&#8217;VE GOTTEN MY SV1/SV2?</strong>
One would expect the climate grouping to drift off-axis based on the distance to the origin
(the distance to the origin being a metric of climate intensity).
Arguably in our case study the summer monsoon half does show a small off-axis trend.
<strong>SUPP.. or just denormalize everywhere so I don&#8217;t need to make a special figures</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_breakdown_in_assumption_a2">A breakdown in assumption <strong>A2</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When climate dipoles don&#8217;t cleanly separate it is typically for the following three reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">the observed parameter is slow to change.</div>
<p>For instance,
when looking at a monsoonal region,
one typically sees a period of wind reversal.
Here a pattern will be hard to define.
The observations made during switch-over can be of any shape,
and there is no mathematical constraint.
However,
working with real data we find that,
when projected on to the SV1 SV2 subspace,
these observation have always mapped to the region between the two climate pattern mixtures
(ie "in the wedge").
"Switch-over" observation are inevitable in any dataset,
however in the case of extremely slow parameters,
they can start to form a significant fraction of the observations.
This is a very typical for parameters such as sea surface temperature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">the region under observation is too large.</div>
<p>For instance,
a region&#8217;s southern section may be under a monsoonal regime,
while the northern section has not yet been affected.
For the Asian monsoon region,
delays in onset and withdrawal can be estimated using the maps made by Wang and LinHo (2002).
From these grids we can approximately estimate that the seasonal switch overs in southern Thailand will happen over ~1-4 pentads.
While we should always expect some switch-over observations -
in large regions we still start to generate a different class of singular vector.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SVs are effectively describing observations as the sum of static patterns.
To describe dynamic systems,
such as a propagating wave,
the decomposition typically degenerates to sums of phase-offset stationary waves.
Such decompositions are useful.
They&#8217;re often explicitly used to characterize wave-like climate systems -
such as the MJO. <strong>Ask Prof Zeng for REF</strong>
However,
such stationary waves are not patterns that are physically meaningful in isolation.
Fundamentally a wave pattern doesn&#8217;t have a positive or negative end point.
Such patterns can typically be phase shifted while preserving their ability to describe the wave propagation.
Fortunately at a small enough scale
(fraction of the wavelength)
wave-like structures look once again like dipoles.
As the wave crest and trough goes through the region,
we once again have positive, negative and transition states.
This issue stresses the need for high density mesoscale data,
such as the IMERG dataset.
They allow us to select regions that are as small as practical.
A region&#8217;s minimum size is dictated by two factors:
The regional topography&#8217;s ability to drive distinct patterns in each phase of the dipole.
The lower value between "number of observation" and "number of points/pixels" dictates the total number of singular vectors.
This may affect the ability to segregate signal from noise. <strong>A BIT UNCLEAR WHY.. TO THINK ABOUT MORE..OR REMOVE?</strong>
Note that the case study was not tuned to a minimal region size -
as our objective was to illustrate climate pattern extraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">the temporal resolution is too coarse.</div>
<p>If we perform the dimension reduction on monthly precipitation averages we will often find months where both climate systems are active. <strong>SUPP</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first two scenarios transition-associated patterns are of an unpredictable shape.
However,
in this third scenario,
as an artifact of integration time,
signals are being actually added together.
This is a bit unusual,
as we do not expect different climate dipoles phases to combine linearly.
The integration-time driven mixing is not indicative of any underlying physical process.
Nonetheless,
looking at the SV1/SV2 subspace,
affected observations will consistently lie between the two climate vectors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a simple case of a breakdown in <strong>A2</strong> we look at sea surface temperature in the South China Sea in <strong>SUPP</strong>.
In such cases,
a large enough breakdown ends up severely skewing the estimates of the ratio axis
(typically towards the mean of the two patterns)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[<strong>Maybe remove this paragraph..? Or maybe it&#8217;s important</strong>]
We do not present any universal turn-key way to label transitional or mixed observations.
In many cases such observations constitute a small fraction of the total,
and therefore have a minimal impact on the final patterns.
Issues can be minimized with a good estimate of the error bounds.
Transition states map poorly to the SV1/SV2 vectors.
See: <strong>SUPP</strong>
On a case by case basis one may wish to build region specific heuristics.
If one has special insight in to climate transitions
(ex: there is some a priori knowledge that seasonal transitions happen twice a year)
then one may try to find criteria for removing problematic observations from the SVD.
We have not found such heuristics necessary,
and caution they may mask other issues.
(See the MJO signal in <strong>SUPP</strong>)
By looking at the SV1/SV2 plot,
it seems evident that even in the ideal case,
any adjustment of the mixing ratio would at best give an extremely modest improvement to the final patterns -
while introducing problematic tuning parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All these issues notwithstanding,
even in the presence of severe skewing,
climate dipole bisection provides a clear improvement over raw EOF vectors.
The EOF basis is guaranteed to be an incorrect mixture,
and the second EOF&#8217;s orthogonality constraint almost guarantees it will miss the mark.
Climate dipole bisection presents a clear,
physically motivated and mathematically simple correction.
There are many alternate methods for trying to correct the EOF.
These are broadly called "EOF rotations", <strong>REF</strong>
and typically try to use SVD rotation methods from applied mathematics on the EOF.
Not only do they persist in being built around the anomaly
(as opposed to raw observations),
but they end up apply methods that have a much more complicated problem in mind;
where signals from different sources are cooccurring in a background of noise.
In the broader signal processing realm,
methods such as the SVD can then be used for such things are denoising.
Special methods like Independent Component Analysis leverage statistical properties of the signals to estimate the original "unmixed" signals.
However,
climate associate patterns sit in a special simpler subset of pattern extraction problems.
As we&#8217;ve hopefully illustrated,
once we assume a very minimal set of properties,
the non-cooccurance of climate dipoles creates a special case where pattern extraction is greatly simplified.
When observing a large phenomena over a small region,
rotations of the EOFs to form a corrected/rotated basis is no longer physically motivated.
Since dipole phases can not undergo mixing there no underlying physical basis to estimate.
<strong>SUPP</strong> <strong>Climate Dipole Bisection as a EOF Rotator</strong>.
In situations where climate system do mix,
they do not mix in a linear/additive fashion like electrical signals.
Hence linear methods such as EOF/SVD should not be used in isolation.
Such cooccuring systems will be the scope of future work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the method as presented has no tuning parameters or climate system specific considerations,
the resulting patterns have the impartiality and repeatability that allow it to become a consensus result that can form the start of further research.</p>
